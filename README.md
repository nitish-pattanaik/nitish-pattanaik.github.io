# MY BLOG
- This repository contains all the code for my personal blog.
- It's a `HUGO` site.
- Uses `Hextra` theme.
- I just used `hextra starter template` to make this repository & then add custom configuration on top of that.
- This will be my OFFICIAL BLOG for now.

## PLAN
- My plan is to upload a blog, whenever I learn something new or interesting or something which is very valuable.
- Typical frequency for blogs will be *weekly*.
