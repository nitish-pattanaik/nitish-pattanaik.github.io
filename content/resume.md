### **Projects**

**Cloud Resource Utilization Prediction & Load Balancing**
- Developed a CNN-LSTM-based system for optimizing cloud resource allocation using PSO-GA hybrid optimization.
- Implemented a load balancer simulator with multiple VMs and tasks (cloudlets) for performance testing.

**Cryptography-based Android Application**
- Built an Android app for text encryption and decryption using AES, DES, and RSA.
- Developed C++-based backend using Android NDK for improved security and performance.

**Machine Translation System Using Helsinki-NLP Model**
- Here I create a machine translation system which translate English text to Hindi text using a pretrained model called Helsinki-NLP.
- In this project I used Helsinki-NLP and finetuned this model using CFILT dataset by IITBombay

**Custom Memory Allocator**
- Designed and implemented a memory allocation system in C++ to optimize memory usage and performance.
- Benchmarked against standard malloc/free, achieving \~20% faster allocations in test scenarios.
